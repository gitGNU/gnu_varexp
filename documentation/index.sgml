    <title>Obtaining the latest Version</title>

    <para>The latest release of the library can be <ulink
url="libvarexp-1.0.tar.gz">downloaded from this web server</ulink>.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Obtaining the original C Version</title>

    <para>This effort is based on the original <application>var</application>
library, which I wrote under contract from Cable &amp; Wireless Deutschland.
This <quote>original</quote> version is written in plain ISO C -- rather than
C++ like this version. It provides almost exactly the same set of features plus
a few new things that were added by the project team there at Cable &amp;
Wireless, so if you're interested in their work, take a look at the library's
page at the <ulink url="http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/var/">OSSP project web
server</ulink>.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>System Requirements</title>

    <para>&varexp; has been written for the UNIX operating system and will
(hopefully) compile on any POSIX-compliant system. It has been tested on Linux,
FreeBSD, Solaris, and MacOS X 10 and built out-of-the-box just fine. Since it
has been written in ISO-C++, it will require a fairly recent compiler, though,
because many older C++ compilers are not ISO C++ compliant. If you're using the
excellent <ulink url="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU C Compiler</ulink>, you should
not have any problem. If you do, please <ulink
url="mailto:simons@cryp.to">send me an e-mail</ulink> and I'll see what I
can do.</para>
