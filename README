Here are the compressed sources:

* varexp-1.2.tar.gz_   (111KB)

Here are the GPG detached signatures:

* varexp-1.2.tar.gz.sig_

You can use either of the above signature files to verify that the
corresponding file (without the .sig suffix) is intact. First, be sure
to download both the .sig file and the corresponding tarball. Then, run
a command like this::

  gpg --verify varexp-1.2.tar.gz.sig

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
then run this command to import it::

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 99089D72

and rerun the ``gpg --verify`` command.
